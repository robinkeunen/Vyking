Vyking compiler

Robin Keunen
Pierre Vyncke

This projects aims to develop a simple compiler for the Vyking language. The syntax is inspired from Python. 
The compiler was built as an assignment at the University of Li√®ge.

The compiler is written in Python and uses PLY lexer/parser. The compiler targets LLVM bytecode

Lexing and parsing are done. Type checking is only a stub, it does not go very far in the analysis. 
Code generation is not finished yet.
